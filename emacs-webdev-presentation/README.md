Preston
=======

Preston is a simple presentation tool that is run in the browser - in that sense it
is like [S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/), or the [HTML5 slides template](http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/). Where it differs is

1. You write in a simple text format that's based on markdown.
2. There are two windows running during the presentation, one for the slides, and the other for your notes. The two windows are always synchronized.
3. Preston is more geared towards [Takahashi style](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html) presentations (big text, big graphics), although it should work with more tradition styles.

Demo

Check out the ***[live demo](http://airportyh.github.com/Preston/)***.

Usage
-----

To create your first presentation using Preston, first, you need to clone the code
from github:

    git clone https://github.com/airportyh/Preston
    
Then edit `presentation.md` to start writing the presentation.

To run the presentation, open `index.html`, and press the "Start Presentation" button.

Presentation File Format
------------------------

The format of `presentation.md` is based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), but is not exactly
Markdown. The big difference is that, I have stolen the indentation feature of markdown
and used it to denote notes for a slide.

### Example

    Slide 1
    
        (these are the notes) Hello, this is slide 1 where I will
        talk about topic one for about 10 seconds.
        
    Slide 2
    
        Now I will talk about slide 2 for a few seconds as well.
        
Here we have two slides. The first slide will consist of the text "Slide 1" and the second
"Slide 2". The indented text below each of them are the notes for that slide, which
will be on your second screen and invisible to the audience during the presentation.

### Markdown

Both the content for the slides and the notes are run through Markdown,
so you can use things like links and images and basically anything in Markdown.

***That is, except for code blocks***

So, by using indentation for notes (effectively breaking Markdown compatibility)
I introduced a problem - now you can't use indentation for code blocks.

    <pre>
        YOUR CODE HERE
    </pre>

The solution is to use the pre tag to wrap your code blocks. It's not great,
but it's the best I could think of and I think it's adequate. And it's still
valid markdown.

Browser Support
---------------

The browser support is fairly limited at the moment. Only the latest versions of
***Safari*** and ***Firefox*** have been tested to work. Chrome has a restriction against
using XHR for local files, which causes Preston to break when opened locally - although it
works when served via HTTP.

Styling
-------

If you don't like the default styling of the slides - which I can totally understand -
simply edit `style.css` and you are off. `index.html` is the page with the slides and the
notes side-by-side, and `slide.html` is the page with only the slides.
